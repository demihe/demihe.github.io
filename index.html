I never truly knew what I wanted to pursue in technology until I began diving deeper to discover that any great software or well designed product stems from the UX industry. A sleek, efficient and functional user experience, combined with a beautiful user interface, is what truly makes a great product. As a designer, it's in my nature to combine these elements to produce something that is both breathtaking and user/business defined. <br /> </p>

                                The goal of this project is to redesign the UNLV (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) Guest Wifi Portal to be easy to connect, informative, and UNLV branded. The old portal was last updated in 2005 and contained 
                                extraneous and repeated information. With the new design, the information has to be straightforward and
                                reflect UNLV branding. This portal serves over 4,000 guests, students, staff, and faculty per day at UNLV.<br /> <br />

                            <h5>2. Research</h5>
                                In the research for this project, I asked the UNLV Networking Engineering department, who created the initial portal, about the users' demographics and how often the portal is used. As mentioned above, users include guests, students, staff, faculty. Majority of the users are guests who are visiting the UNLV campus, who do not study or work at UNLV. These guests include possible incoming students, inquiring parents, visiting professors, visiting speakers, affliated UNLV members, and so forth. Most users are 18 years old and above. According to a network engineer, the portal is used by over 4,000 guests per day. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <h5>3. Document</h5>
                                Analzying the research, it was determined that typical guest users connect to the guest wifi to learn more about UNLV, or use the wifi to work along with someone affliated at UNLV. Thus, it was important to distinguish the availability section for these users, since their time frame on the Wifi is limited. Since this portal is very simple and contains small amounts of information, the design needed to straightforward and quick to connect to accommadate for the guests.

                                Based on the old portal's design and user research, the brainstorming and sketching began. Since there was only one single page, I kept the sketches and wireframes simple.<br /><br />

                                Users should quickly understand how to connect to the guest wifi, as well as acknowledge the specific
                                time frame available for them. This design is now currently being used as the official UNLV Guest Wifi Portal.

                            For this proof of concept, the goal was to create a mobile UI that presented two things: nutritional results of a scanned food item (scanned through phone) and relevant ads displayed within the app. Once an item is scanned, results will display nutritional information such as fat, carbohydrates, protein, and so forth. To gain revenue through this app, the scanning and results page should display suggested ads similar to the scanned food item or healthy food alternatives. <br /><br />
                            Requirements: <br />
                             <ul>
                                        <li>Create a categories page for users to select item they want to scan</li>

                                        <li>Display specific nutrition results, such as fat, carbohydrates, sugar, protein, etc</li>
                                        <li>Incorporate relevant ads that are tailored or similar to the item being scanned</li>
                                        <li>Implement two different styles for the UI</li>

                            <h5>2. Research</h5>
                            To understand the user demographic and what a typical nutritional app looks like, I looked through the Play Store and App Store to see what was currently available and interviewed multiple people. From what I've seen, many nutritional apps not only incorporate nutritional results, but also the ability to input weight, weight advice, calendar options, etc. Looking through the reviews for multiple apps, the user demographic includes users who are trying to lose weight, users who are already fit and trying to maintain their current status, users who are looking to be healthier, etc. Users ages fit within a broad range, from mid 20s to mid 40s, based on interviews around the department I was working in. 
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <h5>3. Document</h5>
                            Analyzing the research, it was decided that the app should be dedicated to just strictly nutritional results and that it should be geared towards the younger audience, from mid 20s to late 30s. The app will be used by users who are more comfortable with technology, as the proof of concept involves a scanning device that has to be connected to the phone.

                               The theme in this design reflects the typical, bright, colorful palette of fruits
                               and vegetables. Created with this palette in mind, the UI for the app appeals to the user in a way of reminding them what an app about nutrition should look and feel, as if they're in a grocery store!
                                <p><strong>Design B:</strong> This theme takes a different turn from the normal color spectrum of foods.
                               Instead, it reflects a more futuristic, modern design that is tied with an overall white, green, and blue palette. This whole minimal, transparent trend contrasts a regular, traditional nutritional app design.<br /><br />

                            <h5>Background:</h5> This senior design project consisted of eight team members creating a software suite called Convention Logistics Tracker (thats me, second to the left! One member is not pictured). We won First Place at the 2017 Senior Design Competition for the Computer Science category. I was an Android developer on this team, and focused mainly on the app development and UX/UI design for the app. <br /><br />
                            The suite contains three software packages: organizer portal, exhibitor portal, and consumer app. In the organizer portal, conference organizers are able to update app information and conference details, such as floor plans, weekly/daily schedules, exhibitors lists, news, and so forth. The exhibitor portal is either filled out by a conference organizer or the exhibitor themselves. Here, exhibitors can upload a description, company logo, and news items for their own booth. For the consumer app, the other app developer and I focused on creating an Android app that displayed all the data pulled from the Exhibitor and Organizer portal (based on the self built REST API my team had created). Features of the app include News, Exhibitors List, Floor Plan, and Schedule.<br /><br />
                            <h4><center>Process</center></h4>

                            <h5>1. Define</h5>
                                The origination of developing a software suite for a convention stemmed from one of the team members, who had attended CES 2016. While CES had an app available for attendees, he faced multiple issues with it, from slow and late updates, to poor user experience. As a team, we identified some main problems we wanted to target in our project:<br /> <br /> 
                                
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Conventions require massive amounts of manpower and time to plan</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Securing a convention venue </li>
                                        <li>Handling exhibitor and attendee registration</li>
                                        <li>Organizing shuttling services and parking </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Planning larger conventions is cumbersome without proper organization</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Registration becomes tedious to handle</li>
                                        <li>Overhead and complexity increase with the size of the convention</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </ul>

                                There were many functional requirements for this project. To minimize the amount of text, I will only focus on those for the app. <br /> <br />
                                Requirements for Android app: <br />
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>News section</li>
                                        <li>Exhibitor's List</li>
                                        <li>Floor Plan</li>
                                        <li>Schedule</li>
                                    </ul>
                            <br />
                            <h5>2. Research</h5>
                                After identifying the problems, we researched online to find the current solutions from similar
                                companies which were actually not NOT viable solutions: <br /><br />
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>Paper maps dominate as the current standard but:</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Printing paper maps and brochures come at a hefty cost; 170 trees</li>
                                        <li>These physical copies are bulky and wasteful; 10 pounds</li>
                                        <li>Organizing shuttling services and parking </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Other consumer applications in the market are spotty and non-reusable</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>These per-convention applications lack flexibility</li>
                                        <li>Developing a new application for each hosted convention is inefficient</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    </ul>
                                    We researched more about the conferences industry and found 44% of revenue comes from exhibit sales and design services. We created a few use case diagrams to understand who our audience
                                    would be and how they will interact with our system. Typical users are business owners, industry leaders, investors, company employees, buyers, sellers, etc. Going to a convention or conference means business.

                                Based on the research, it was noted that we needed to appeal to the current market by providing new and smarter alternatives to the existing solutions.  For the app, we needed to figure out a way to display the four required components: News, Exhibitors List, Floor Plan, and Schedule. Our features would have to outdo the competitors, as shown in the chart below: <br /> <br/>
                                <img src="img/portfolio/chart.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <h5>4. Design</h5>
                                The other app dev and I worked together in Android Studio to build the app. We created some sketches and wireframes before building the skeleton of the app, making sure we included the featured app requirements. Since the app did not require a very complex UI, we made the user experience very straightforward. For the branding of this project, I created the logo for the suite, which set the color scheme and font choices in stone for the other components of the software suite. <br /><br />

                                My team worked incredibly well together and worked very hard to create a solid deliverable. The front end team and back end team worked seamlessly to provide a reliable REST API for the app team. We presented our project at the Senior Design Competition in front of 5 judges of different academic backgrounds. We uploaded the app to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clt.conventionlogistictracker&hl=en" target="_blank">Play store</a> and the site and app were live at that time. In the final product, we tested our software suite by using it live during the Senior Design Competition as a conference. However, due to server costs, we were unable to keep the portals and app live past an extended time.
